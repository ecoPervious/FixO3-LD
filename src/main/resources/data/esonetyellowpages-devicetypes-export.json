        "comment":"The BoWaSnapper is a Multihorizon-BottomWaterSampler, suitable for deep-sea deployment and used for the investigation of the sediment-water interface (particles, organisms, geochemical tracers). It has been developed in collaboration with Dr. E. Sauter from Alfred-Wegener-Institute, Bremerhaven, and is successfully in use at water depths between 20 m and 5500 m since 2001. The BoWaSnapper enables the high resolutive sampling of the bottom closest water layers within a very short period (some minutes only). Six water bottles vertically adjustable and attached to the middle axis carry out the water sampling. Equipped with an autonomous bottom releaser that closes the water bottles some minutes after the touch-down on the sea bed, the Multihorizon-BottomWaterSampler can be used with any serial wire, i. e. no data transfer cable is necessary.",

Measuring only 55 x 37 x 26 mm OEM (matchbox size) the unit can provide highly dynamic pitch and roll readings at a frequency up to 50 Hz. The tiny size is possible by utilising MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors. MEMS is the integration of mechanical elements, sensors, actuators, and electronics on a common silicon substrate through the utilization of microfabrication technology. At an output rate of 50 Hz the sensor returns an accuracy better than 0.5 degree over the range of +/- 30 degrees. A range of oversampling settings allows the selection of output rates down to 1 Hz, where the accuracy is better than 0.2 degrees. A topside software package provides graphic and numeric indication of the pitch and roll readings and allows the selection of a variety of data output formats. Internal DIP switches allow the selection of various options within the device. A surface version and two subsea versions (3000 m and 6000 m) are available. The unit can also be supplied as an OEM part for inclusion in your equipment.",

A PVC nose cone protects it from side impacts, while maintaining a streamlined tow body. We have never lost a SeaSPY from the connector, except for the time someone threw one overboard without connecting it to the cable. While theres some human error no mag can account for, the story has a happy ending: the customer went back a year later and found their SeaSPY in working condition. SeaSPYs sleek design resists snags.e inexpensive and field replaceable tailfins are the only protruding element, and they are designed to snap off should they ever get snagged on rocky outcroppings. The SeaSPY towfish is made of \" super strong fiberglass coated with a bumper layer of polyurethane for extra shock absorption. Should even a drop of water penetrate the towfish, a leak detector warning appears on your screen to inform you. Call us overprotective, but in the event of a breach, SeaSPYs electronics module is encased in a polycarbonate housing with O ring seals for another layer of security. The sensor itself is suspended on shockmounts to ensure the quality of your data isnt influenced even if you drag SeaSPY along the sea floor.",

The low power requirements make it ideal for applications where battery drain is a concern. Sensitivity is selected by two digital lines which can be hard wired or microprocessor controlled, thereby choosing the appropriate range and resolution for measurement of extremely clean to very turbid waters. The offset voltage is within 1 mV of zero and requires no adjustment across gains. The unique optical design confines the sensing volume to within 5 cm of the sensor allowing near-bottom measurements and minimizing errant reflections in restricted spaces. The sensor is easily interfaced with data acquisition packages; a 5 ft pigtail is supplied. Custom configurations are available.",

In fjords or other areas with limited exchange of water. Around fish farms. In areas interesting for dumping of mine or dredging waste.The Aanderaa Oxygen Optodes are based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers.The fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water.This sensing foil is attached to a sapphire window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight titanium housing.The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured (see illustration overleaf). By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined.",

Typical application accuracy of 0.01% is achieved even under difficult environmental conditions. Desirable characteristics include excellent long-term stability, 1 x 10e-8 resolution, low power consumption, and high reliability.The remarkable performance of these depth sensors is achieved through the use of a precision quartz crystal resonator whose frequency of oscillation varies with pressure-induced stress. A quartz crystal temperature signal is provided to thermally compensate the calculated pressure and achieve high accuracy over a broad range of temperatures. The depth sensors include waterproof housings with integral shock protection.High accuracy, resolution, and stability make Digiquartz Depth Sensors ideal for applications such as Tsunami detection, wave and tide gauges, platform leveling, underwater pipe laying, and as depth sensors in ROVs and AUVs.All Depth Sensor ranges are available with either frequency outputs or integral intelligent electronics with bi-directional digital communications.",

        "comment":"Conductivity is a key parameter for in-situ determination of several fundamental physical properties of seawater. For seawater, the ability to conduct electrical current is mostly dependent on temperature and the amount of inorganic dissolved solids. This means that, together with temperature and depth information, a good estimate of the salinity may be determined. Salinity is defined as the concentration of dissolved solids. The Conductivity Sensors are based on an inductive principle. This provides for stable measurement without electrodes that are easily fouled and may wear out in the field. Utilization of miniature components has made it possible to integrate all the required electronics. A digital signal processor calculates salinity, density and speed of sound. The salinity and density are calculated according to the UNESCO International Equation of State (IES 80). The Conductivity Sensor 3919/3919IW outputs data in both RS-232 and Aanderaa SR10 format. 4119 outputs SR10 format, while 4120IW has analog output as well as RS-232. All three sensors are available in A and B versions; version B has enhanced accuracy compared to version A. Additionally, sensor 3919 is available in two depth ratings as well: 6000 m (3919) and 2000 m (3919 IW; Intermediate Water). Refer specifications on next page. On the RS-232 output the Conductivity in mS/cm, as well as Temperature, Salinity, Density and Speed of sound may be presented. Two SR10 channels are available; one of the SR10 outputs can be configured to present Conductivity, Salinity, Density or Speed of Sound, while the other SR10 output presents the temperature measurement. The user may configure the range on both SR10 outputs. This allows for a possibility to zoom in on the range of interest. Conductivity Sensor 3919 is designed to operate down to 6000 meters, 3919 IW is designed to operate down to 2000 meters, while 4119 and 4120IW are designed to operate down to 1000 m. The Conductivity Sensors are available for Recording Current Meters RCM 9, RCM 9 MkII, RCM 9 IW, RCM 9 LW and RCM 11, Recording Doppler Current Profiler RDCP 600 as well as a stand-alone RS-232 sensor for other applications.",

        "comment":"Aqua Monitor is a novel water sampler that can collect 50 samples of up to 1000 ml each. The samples are captured using a high integrity syringe mechanism and then injected into flexible bags via a 50-way multi-port valve. Samples are stored for post recovery analysis. Aqua Monitor can be used in moored or towed-vehicle applications to collect 50 discrete samples. Originally designed as a versatile water and phytoplankton sampler the device may be programmed for autonomous sampling or operated as a \"slave\" within an integrated system such as a towed-vehicle or AUV. The sample volume is user programmable and a macro language allows the operator to easily implement custom in-situ sample processing. Timed sampling control for mooring applications includes two modes: Traditional time-series sample collection via an operator programmable interval and real-time sampling from a user generated schedule of sample times. The real-time mode provides Aqua Monitor with the unique ability to sample coherently with tidal state or acquire bursts of samples each dosed with different preservatives. Aqua Monitor is purpose designed for use in towed-body applications such as within U-Tow. A special deep ocean version of Aqua Monitor is available. The illustration over shows a 2500 m rated system that was successfully deployed in the Denmark Strait at a depth of 1200 m sampling once per week for a year. Aqua Monitor may be used aboard most ROVs and AUVs and has been fitted to the Southampton Oceanography Centres AUV, Autosub, during science missions in the UK.",

The principle of measurement used makes it independent from electrical fields and magnetic effects. It's absolutely linear slope within the whole measuring range gives an easy adaptation to existing firmware. Using comparably large dimensions for the conductivity cell leads to long unattended measuring times, as biological activity at the sensor has only small degrading effects. The sensor's housing is made of titanium and is pressure resistant up to 500 dbar making it ideally suited for long time monitoring systems even at corrosive environments. The connection of the sensor to the data acquisition system is done by a multi-core sea cable for power supply and analogue voltage.",

It measures the ocean current profile while moving and it does it with quality, accuracy, and a great price-performance ratio. With the Nortek VM-Profiler, your marine operations will go faster and you will make operational decisions with better confidence than before. The VM-Profiler works by measuring the Doppler shifted echo from the water below the hull. This Doppler shift is proportional to the water speed relative to the ship. The vessel motion is determined using the ships navigation systems, including the required gyro and DGPS. In the software, the vessel motion is removed from the output data, leaving the user with the true ocean currents in ship coordinates or earth coordinates. The VM-Profiler does not depend on \"bottom track\" as the primary means to measure the vessel motion. As a result, the currents in the near-surface region can be determined regardless of the water depth or the water quality. Further, calibration has never been easier. Make two 5-minute runs and press a software button. The VM-Profiler software does all the rest for you.",

        "comment":"The SBE 8 Microstructure Temperature Sensor is a reliable, lightweight instrument intended for use in marine profiling applications where its high speed and spatial resolving power offer the ability to characterize small scale ocean temperature features. Used in conjunction with the SBE 7 Microstructure Conductivity sensor, the SBE 8 can provide comparably sensitive resolution of salinity and density fields. The sensing element is a remote-cabled, probemounted thermistor (Thermometrics type FP07). The sensor probe is a small, stainless steel assembly that may be mounted at distances up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) from the sensor electronics housing. This arrangement minimizes the effect of the instrument housing and its wake on the data. The thermistor body is O-ring sealed into the sensor assembly to ensure pressure integrity. The thermistor has a 25 C resistance of 270 Kohms and is driven by a DC current derived from a low-noise, 6.9 volt reference and 1 Mohm resistor. The thermistor voltage is buffered by a low-noise FET op amp. The output is subsequently pre-emphasized, so the sensors output increases as a function of the frequency components in the temperature signal. The effect of pre-emphasis is to magnify the sensor output for rapidly changing temperature, thereby overcoming the restrictions on system resolving power that would otherwise be imparted by the use of conventional (e.g., 16-bit) digitizers. The SBE 8s pre-emphasis response magnifies a 20 Hz temperature signal by a factor of 200, thus facilitating acquisition of signals 200 times smaller than could be characterized by conventional CTD sensors.",

        "comment":"SBE 4 series conductivity sensors are modular, self-contained instruments that measure conductivity from 0 to 7 S/m (Siemens/meter), thus covering the full range of lake and oceanic applications. The sensors (Version 2; S/N 2000 and higher) have electrically isolated power circuits and optically coupled outputs to eliminate any possibility of noise and corrosion caused by ground loops. Interfacing is also simplified by the square-wave variable frequency output signal (nominally 2.5 to 7.5 kHz, corresponding to 0 to 7 S/m). The sensors offer improved temperature compensation, smaller fit residuals, and faster turn-on stabilization times. Supply voltage range is 6 to 24 volts. The SBE 4C is a primary sensor for the SBE 9plus CTD Underwater Unit and SBE 25 SEALOGGER CTD. Available in 6800 m aluminium or 10500 m titanium housing, the SBE 4C has a quick-disconnect fitting to simplify plumbing to the CTD pump. The SBE 4M is intended for long-term moored deployments. Available with a 3400 m or 6800 m aluminium housing or 10500 m titanium housing, the SBE 4M is supplied without the quick-disconnect fitting. The sensing element is a cylindrical flow-through borosilicate glass cell with three internal platinum electrodes. The electrode arrangement offers distinct advantages over inductive or open external field cells. Because the outer electrodes are connected together, electric fields are confined inside the cell, making the measured resistance (and instrument calibration) independent of calibration bath size or proximity to protective cages or other objects. The cell resistance controls the output frequency of a Wien Bridge oscillator circuit. A unique Sea-Bird design feature introduces a fixed conductivity offset, permitting the instrument to measure conductivity down to 0 for fresh water work.",

The SBE 3plus is a more rigorously tested and calibrated version of our SBE 3F temperature sensor. A sensor is designated as an SBE 3plus only after demonstrating drift of less than 0.001 C during a six-month screening period. In addition, the time response is carefully measured and verified to be 0.065  0.010 seconds. Every SBE 3plus is calibrated in Sea-Bird's computer-controlled calibration baths. These superlow-gradient baths produce temperature calibrations with resolution and accuracy not previously available to oceanographers. These sensors can be successfully calibrated as separate modules because they have built-in acquisition circuits and frequency outputs. When used with a Sea-Bird CTD, overall system accuracy is limited only by the accuracy of the CTD's master clock. Errors from this source are demonstrably negligible (in the SBE 911plus CTD, clock error contribution is 0.00016 C based on a five-year worst case error budget including ambient temperature influence of 1 ppm total over -20 to +70 C, plus 1 ppm first year drift, plus four additional years drift at 0.3 ppm per year).",

A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water.This sensing foil is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight titanium housing.The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured (see illustration overleaf).By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined.The lifetime-based luminescence quenching principle offers the following advantages over electro-chemical sensors: Not stirring sensitive (it consumes no oxygen) Less affected by fouling Measures absolute oxygen concentrations without repeated calibrations Better long-term stability Less affected by pressure Pressure behaviour is predictable Faster response time.The sensor is designed to operate down to 300 meters. It fits directly on to the top end-plate of Recording Current Meter RCM 9, and other Aanderaa instruments.",

Specifically the ANALITE 180 and 190 probes are designed for applications that will not allow bio-fouling to build up such as short monitoring deployment or placement in fast and cold running water. The ANALITE 195 however, with its integral wiper assembly, is designed where bio-fouling or sedimentation buildup is likely. The ANALITE 180, 190 and 195 probes may be submerged to a depth rating of 30 meters (approx. 100 feet). This pressure rating applies to static (non-flowing) water. The ANALITE 190 and 195 probes uses 90 optics and employs infrared light in accordance with ISO7027. All probes use a unique modulation technique that ensures almost total rejection of ambient light conditions.",

The 39 is intended for moorings or other long-term, fixed-site applications, as well as shorter-term deployments on nets, towed vehicles, or ROVs. Calibration coefficients are stored in EEPROM, and uploaded data is in ASCII engineering units (C and decibars). The 39s thermistor, the same sensor used in the SBE 16plus V2 SEACAT and 37 MicroCAT, has a long history of exceptional accuracy and stability; drift is typically less than 0.002 C per year. Two configurations are offered: Thermistor embedded in titanium endcap (25-second time constant), for rugged conditions. External thermistor in pressure-protected sheath (0.5-second time constant), for fast sampling.The 39s optional Druck pressure sensor employs a micro-machined silicon diaphragm in which the strain elements are implanted with semiconductor fabrication techniques. Unlike metal diaphragms, silicons crystal structure is perfectly elastic, so the sensor is essentially free of pressure hysteresis. Compensation of temperature influence on pressure offset and scale is performed by the 39s CPU.",

The Pulse 12 comes with a Control Box, a Search Coil with 150 feet of cable, and a Fish. The Search Coil mounts on the Fish and is towed through the water at 1 - 4 mph. The Control Box has inputs for three Search Coils. Two additional Search Coils can be added at any time and come complete with cable and fish. The additional Coils allow larger areas to be covered. One Fish is towed directly behind the center of the boat and the other Fish are towed to each side of the boat. One, two, or three Fish can be operating at the same time. When using multiple Fish, each has its own controls and meter on the Control Box. An alarm sounds and the meter swings up when any of the Search Coils detect a target. The complete system is powered by two 12 volt batteries. An Altimeter can be attached to the Fish to inform the operator of the distance between the Fish and the bottom.

The sensors can be connected in-series using UW underwater cables and suspended vertically in a water column or horizontally along a stream or riverbed. Double o ring seals ensure a waterproof sensor connection. Temperature data is transmitted on a 1-wire temp string bus. In addition to the 1-wire bus, the T-Node offers pass-through signals for SDI-12 and RS-485, allowing the user to connect Nodes and other environmental measurement sensors along the string. This sensorBUS architecture has been designed so that researchers can easily build and customize multi-point temperature strings or more powerful environmental monitoring networks. The T-Node sensors feature a plug-&-play interface to NexSens SDL500 submersible data loggers and offshore data buoys. Data collection options include standalone, radio, and cellular telemetry. NexSens iChart Software is a Windows-based program for interfacing both locally (direct-connect) and remotely (through telemetry) to an SDL500 data logger or network of data loggers.

Oxygen is involved in most of the biological and chemical processes in aquatic environments and in the process industry. It is important to measure the oxygen content in environments where the oxygen concentration is critical, e.g. in: Process industry controllers Water and waste water systems Ships Ballast water Aquaculture Fjords or other areas with limited exchange of waterThe AADI oxygen sensor is based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers. The fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water. This sensing foil is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight housing. The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured (see illustration overleaf). By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined. The lifetime-based luminescence quenching principle offers the following advantages over competing sensors: Not stirring sensitive (it consumes no oxygen) Unaffected by fouling Measures absolute oxygen concentrations without repeated calibrations Long-term stability: 3 to 5 years Not affected by pressure Faster response timeThe sensor is designed to operate down to 100 meters.",

        "comment":"Conductivity is a key parameter for in-situ determination of several fundamental physical properties of seawater. For seawater, the ability to conduct electrical current is mostly dependent on temperature and the amount of inorganic dissolved solids. This means that, together with temperature and depth information, a good estimate of the salinity may be determined. Salinity is defined as the concentration of dissolved solids. The Conductivity Sensors are based on an inductive principle. This provides for stable measurement without electrodes that are easily fouled and may wear out in the field. Utilization of miniature components has made it possible to integrate all the required electronics. A digital signal processor calculates salinity, density and speed of sound. The salinity and density are calculated according to the UNESCO International Equation of State (IES 80). The Conductivity Sensor 3919/3919IW outputs data in both RS-232 and Aanderaa SR10 format. 4119 outputs SR10 format, while 4120IW has analog output as well as RS-232. All three sensors are available in A and B versions; version B has enhanced accuracy compared to version A. Additionally, sensor 3919 is available in two depth ratings as well: 6000 m (3919) and 2000 m (3919 IW; Intermediate Water). Refer specifications on next page. On the RS-232 output the Conductivity in mS/cm, as well as Temperature, Salinity, Density and Speed of sound may be presented. Two SR10 channels are available; one of the SR10 outputs can be configured to present Conductivity, Salinity, Density or Speed of Sound, while the other SR10 output presents the temperature measurement. The user may configure the range on both SR10 outputs. This allows for a possibility to zoom in on the range of interest. Conductivity Sensor 3919 is designed to operate down to 6000 meters, 3919 IW is designed to operate down to 2000 meters, while 4119 and 4120IW are designed to operate down to 1000 m. The Conductivity Sensors are available for Recording Current Meters RCM 9, RCM 9 MkII, RCM 9 IW, RCM 9 LW and RCM 11, Recording Doppler Current Profiler RDCP 600 as well as a stand-alone RS-232 sensor for other applications.",

The ANALITE 160 turbidity meter allows the user to set up measurement parameters through a user-friendly menu system displayed on the in-built 2 line alphanumeric display. Three probes are currently available to suit the ANALITE NEP160 display unit, the NEP260 (ISO7027 to 3,000 NTU), NEP280 (retro-scatter to 30,000 NTU) and the high temperature rated NEP285 (retro-scatter to 30,000 NTU). Other probes may be added to the range from time to time. The probes have a depth rating of 100 meters and the display unit is IP65 rated. All ANALITE NEP160 compliant probes are hot swappable and contain their calibration data in the probe proper thereby avaoiding the need to calibrate every time another probe is connected. The NEP160 (and its probes) comes supplied precalibrated however the user can calibrate a probe at any time using the simple menu driven interface. Both 2 and 3 point calibrations can be preformed. Measurements can be read directly from the display at any time or downloaded to a computer/printer through the RS232 output at user selectable periodic intervals. The ANALITE NEP160 will power up automatically to its last settings whenever external power is applied making it ideal for logging applications when using the analogue output or RS232 port. The NEP160 comes complete in a convenient carry case. The carry case can accommodate a probe with a cable length of up to 10 meters, an ac adapter, the display unit, the RS232 cabling and the User Manual.",

Measurements of Conductivity together with Temperature and Depth improves the RDCP 600 virtual sensors, like Salinity and Speed of Sound. These parameters strongely improves the calculated current speed and cell position, making our RDCP 600 a very good CTD instrument when used with the conductivity sensor 4019 and the high accuracy pressure sensor 3187. The Conductivity Sensors 4019A and 4019B are based on an inductive principle. This provides for stable measurement without electrodes that are easily fouled and may wear out in the field. Utilization of miniature components has made it possible to integrate all the required electronics. The output parameter is electrical conductivity in mS/cm, which is sent to the RDCP via the RDCP Internalbus. The sensors are designed to operate down to 6000 meters.

In fjords or other areas with limited exchange of water. Around fish farms. In areas interesting for dumping of mine or dredging waste.The Aanderaa Oxygen Optodes are based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers.The fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water.This sensing foil is attached to a sapphire window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight titanium housing.The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured (see illustration overleaf). By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined.",

        "comment":"The Aquadopp profiler measures the current profile in water using acoustic Doppler technology. It is designed for stationary applications and can be deployed on the bottom, on a mooring rig, on a buoy or on any other fixed structure.It is a complete instrument and includes all the parts required for a self contained deployment with data stored to an internal data logger. Typical applications include coastal studies, online monitoring and scientific studies in rivers, lakes, and channels. The Aquadopp profiler uses three acoustic beams slanted at 25 to accurately measure the current profile in a user selectable number of cells. The internal tilt and compass sensors tell the current direction and the high-resolution pressure sensor gives the depthand the tidal elevation if the system is fixed mounted. The standard 9 MB recorder and internal alkaline batteries are typically sufficient for a 24 month deployment. Deployment times can be increased or sampling schemes intensified by expanding to 161 MB memory and external batteries.",

It measures the ocean current profile while moving and it does it with quality, accuracy, and a great price-performance ratio. With the Nortek VM-Profiler, your marine operations will go faster and you will make operational decisions with better confidence than before. The VM-Profiler works by measuring the Doppler shifted echo from the water below the hull. This Doppler shift is proportional to the water speed relative to the ship. The vessel motion is determined using the ships navigation systems, including the required gyro and DGPS. In the software, the vessel motion is removed from the output data, leaving the user with the true ocean currents in ship coordinates or earth coordinates. The VM-Profiler does not depend on \"bottom track\" as the primary means to measure the vessel motion. As a result, the currents in the near-surface region can be determined regardless of the water depth or the water quality. Further, calibration has never been easier. Make two 5-minute runs and press a software button. The VM-Profiler software does all the rest for you.",

The SBE 38 is unaffected by shock and vibration, has high accuracy and stability, and is easy to use. It has a rugged, corrosion-proof, 10,500 meter (34,400 foot) titanium pressure housing. Real-time temperature data is transmitted in ASCII characters (C or raw counts) via an RS-232 or optional RS-485 serial interface for display or logging by PC or data logger. The SBE 38s measurement range is -5 to +35 C; absolute accuracy is better than 0.001 C (1 mK) and resolution is approximately 0.00025 C (0.25 mK). Each sensor includes certification that demonstrates drift of less than 0.001 C (1 mK) during a six-month period. Applications include calibration baths, oceanographic/aquatic research, and environmental monitoring. The SBE 38 is frequently integrated as a remote temperature sensor with an SBE 21 Thermosalinograph or SBE 45 MicroTSG, to provide accurate sea surface temperature. It can also be integrated as a secondary temperature sensor with an SBE 16plus, 16plus-IM, 16plus V2, 16plus-IM V2, or 19plus V2 SEACAT CTD.",

Recorded data is stored in the loggers internal memory with a real time reference for each measurement.DST comp-tilt can be used in animals both implanted internally and attatched externally. For external tagging Star-Oddi can provide a specially designed DST fastener kit. Star-Oddi also offers protective logger housings for use at fixed locations or harsh environments.The DST comp-tilt is supported by the SeaStar software and the Communication Box which serves as an interface between the logger and a PC.  Communication between the logger and the Communication Box is wireless.In SeaStar, the user sets the start time, start date and sampling interval before starting the recorder. Up to seven different intervals can be set for the same measurement sequence. This is especially useful when more frequent measurements are needed at a certain time period.With default programming depth, temperature, relative compass heading and tilt are recorded at the same time. Optionally, temperature-depth and compass-tilt can be set as primary and secondary parameter pairs with different sampling frequency. That way memory partitioning can be customized according to individual preferences.When the DST is recovered, recorded data is uploaded to SeaStar where results are displayed both in graphic and tabular form.

In accordance with USEPA Method 180.1 for turbidity measurement, the WQ720 is a 90 degree scatter nephelometer. The sensor directs a focused beam into the subject water. The light beam reflects off particles in the water, and the resultant light intensity is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90 degrees to the light beam. The detected light intensity is directly proportional to the turbidity of the water. The turbidity sensor uses a second light detector to correct for light intensity variations, color changes, and minor lens fouling. For environmental monitoring, simply place the sensor directly in the water and position it where the turbidity is to be monitored. For process monitoring, you can place the sensor into a low-pressure pipe for online monitoring using a standard 1.5\" compression coupler.",

Our updated state-of-the-art technology allows for a compact design capable of storing up to 179,178 sets of 4-channel data, consisting of chlorophyll, turbidity, temperature and battery voltage. This facilitates up to one year of continuous measurement.The memory media, non-volatile flash-memory IC's, protect data from loss resulting from irregular battery voltage. This feature improves reliability.A circular array of light emitting diodes (LED's) provides the excitation light for the chlorophyll-a fluorescence and the turbidity backscatter sensors. Optical filters in front of the optical receivers separate the backscattered light (turbidity) from the fluorescence signals. The filters also prevent the influence of solar light on the measurements.A wiper sweeps the optical surface before each sample to remote dirt and residue. This improves the repeatability of the measurements and makes long-term deployments possible.The turbidity sensor has a superior stability in low concentration areas and the correlation with suspended sediment in high concentration areas has been improved. The instrument, therefore, can be used not only in the marine field but also in river and dam applications.Compact-CLW is controlled through the PC serial port, RS-232C. The main unit records calendar and time information with each sample and the sensor's calibration coefficients are stored in the built-in memory. The basic measurement setup requires only the selections of the start time and the sampling interval.The data transfer after the completion of the deployment is easily accomplished. Information, such as measurement start time and calibration coefficients, are transferred together with the measured data. The user is free from troublesome coefficient control. Data can be processed quickly and effortlessly.The data processing program offers clear and logical screens for easy operation.",

A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water.This sensing foil is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight titanium housing.The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured (see illustration overleaf).By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined.The lifetime-based luminescence quenching principle offers the following advantages over electro-chemical sensors: Not stirring sensitive (it consumes no oxygen) Less affected by fouling Measures absolute oxygen concentrations without repeated calibrations Better long-term stability Less affected by pressure Pressure behaviour is predictable Faster response time.The sensor is designed to operate down to 300 meters. It fits directly on to the top end-plate of Recording Current Meter RCM 9, and other Aanderaa instruments.",

The bottle closing mechanism is a magnetically actuated lanyard release latch derived from the SBE 32 Carousel Water Sampler, which has a long history of reliability and ease-of-use. Lanyards are rigged to hold bottles open when lanyards are attached to the release latches. A pressure-proof electromagnet is energized on command to trigger a lanyard release, allowing the bottle to close. The ECO can be configured with one or two 3-position lanyard release modules. Each release module is connected to the ECOs Electronics Control Module by a separate cable, allowing easy do-it-yourself expansion from a three-bottle to a six-bottle system. The ECO includes the Electronics Control Module (ECM), one or two lanyard release modules, three or six 4-liter ECO sample bottles mounted in saddle brackets and fastened with band clamps, stainless steel guard frame with integral lifting bail, and mesh panels for mounting the ECM, CTD, and other sensors that may be integrated with the CTD (e.g., dissolved oxygen sensor, fluorometer, turbidity sensor, etc.). CTD mounting brackets and interface cable, auxiliary sensors, and (for real-time operation) SBE 33 Carousel Deck Unit must be ordered separately.",

The SBE 35RT makes a temperature measurement each time a bottle fire confirmation is received, and stores the value in EEPROM. Each stored value contains the time and bottle position in addition to the temperature data, allowing comparison of the SBE 35RT record with CTD and water bottle data. Using one SBE 35RT eliminates the need for reversing thermometers, and provides higher accuracy temperature readings at lower cost. Calibration coefficients stored in EEPROM allow the SBE 35RT to transmit data in engineering units. SEATERM, the terminal program in our SEASOFT-Win32 software suite, provides easy SBE 35RT setup and data uploading.

        "comment":"Conductivity Sensor 4319 is a compact fully integrated sensor for measuring the electrical conductivity of seawater. It is designed to be mounted on the SEAGUARD Platform. Conductivity is a key parameter for in-situ determination of several fundamental physical properties of seawater. For seawater, the ability to conduct electrical current is mostly dependent on temperature and the amount of inorganic dissolved solids. This means that, together with temperature and depth information, a good estimate of the salinity may be determined. Salinity is defined as the concentration of dissolved solids. Other important properties of seawater are again dependent on the salinity. Among these are the density and the speed of sound. The Conductivity Sensor 4319 is based on an inductive principle. This provides for stable measurement with out electrodes that are easily fouled and may wear out in the field. Utilization of miniature components have made it possible to integrate all the required electronics. The Conductivity sensor outputs data in AiCaP CANbus. Both Conductivity in mS/cm, and Temperature in C may be presented. The datalogger and the smart sensor is interfaced by means of a reliable CANbus interface using an XML based protocol (AiCaP). During power-up, the sensors that are connected to the bus will report their capabilities and specifications to the datalogger. The datalogger then assembles the information and provides the user with the possibility to configure the instrument based on the present nodes. The solution provides for great flexibility in both use and design of the different elements within the system. The autonomous sensor topology also gives the sensor designer flexibility and opportunities where each sensor type may be optimized with regard to its operation, each sensor may now provide several parameters without increasing the total system load.",

Each unit employs an absolute pressure gauge, with ranges selectable from 10 dBars (10 metres of water) to 6,600 dBar making the unit suitable for a wide range of applications from borehole testing to groundwater monitoring. For groundwater measurement, a barometric reference may be used to record the atmospheric pressure over the local area.

Every SBE 3F is calibrated in Sea-Bird's computer-controlled calibration baths. These superlow-gradient baths produce temperature calibrations with resolution and accuracy not previously available to oceanographers. These sensors can be successfully calibrated as separate modules because they have built-in acquisition circuits and frequency outputs. When used with a CTD system, overall system accuracy is equal to the sensor accuracy degraded only by the uncertainty in the CTD's master clock. A typically small clock error of 1 ppm affords a temperature error of less than 50 &#956;C.",

With a one gamma sensitivity, it has the maximum usable sensitivity for a towed magnetometer. A two second cycle time gives a strong return signal and is fast enough to detect even small iron/steel targets. The PROTON 4 features a triaxial noise-cancelling sensor that allows omnidirectional towing without heading error or dead zone. The system is fully digitized and displays its output on an easy to read 5 digit LCD that is backlit for night operations. The optional built-in printer creates a permanent record of the mag readouts. The gamma reading is printed out on each cycle and, with input from a GPS receiver, the targets position is also printed out. An alarm informs the operator when the readout changes. An RS232 output and software package are also available. The Fish has excellent hydrodyamic characteristics moving smoothly through the water at tow speeds up to 10 knots. A 2-3 knot tow speed is recommended for small targets. With the optional Altimeter, precise distance off the bottom can be maintained. For deep water towing, the Fish is towed behind a downrigger. The Fish can be towed at almost any speed, but should be towed slow to locate small targets or when towing the Fish deep. A sensitivity switch allows easy pinpointing of targets. Modular construction allows easy field repair, should it ever be necessary. The PROTON 4 is covered by a full TWO YEAR WARRANTY.",

The modem provides reliable, low-cost, real-time data transmission for up to 100 sensors - all 39-IMs or a mix with other IM-capable instruments - using a single, plastic-coated, steel mooring cable. IM instruments clamp anywhere along the inherently rugged mooring cable; expensive and potentially unreliable multiconductor cables are not required. IM sensor moorings are easily reconfigured to meet changing deployment scenarios. Because sensor positions can be altered (or sensors added/deleted) by sliding and re-clamping sensors on the wire, there is no need to design and purchase a new cable with different breakout locations. IM systems permit data telemetry from sensors located anywhere along the mooring wire, making them far more efficient and flexible than acoustic modem types that place serious demands on battery capacity and return data from a single underwater position only. At the surface (typically in a buoy), a Surface Inductive Modem (SIM) completes the link between the sensors and a computer or data logger. Data from the sensor string can be stored and transmitted via satellite link, cell phone, or radio telemetry. As insurance against real-time data loss, the 39-IM simultaneously stores data in its non-volatile memory. The 39-IMs thermistor, the same as used in the SBE 39, has a long history of exceptional accuracy and stability; drift is typically less than 0.002 C/year. Two thermistor configurations are offered: thermistor embedded in titanium end cap (25.0-second time constant) for rugged conditions; or external thermistor in pressure-protected sheath (0.5-second time constant) for fast sampling. The 39-IMs optional Druck pressure sensor employs a micro-machined silicon diaphragm in which the strain elements are implanted with semiconductor fabrication techniques. Unlike metal diaphragms, silicons crystal structure is perfectly elastic, so the sensor is essentially free of pressure hysteresis. Compensation of temperature influence on pressure is performed by the 39-IMs CPU.",

With a range of 3 degrees and pressure rating of 3 MPa, the tiltmeter is suitable for applications such as:  Monitoring the behavior of the concrete face of rockfill dams  Monitoring rotation of piers, piles, and retaining wallsThe deep-water tiltmeter consists of an electrolytic tilt sensor housed in a heavy brass enclosure.The tiltmeter mounting surface should be horizontal and flat. If the tiltmeter is to be mounted on an inclined surface, a horizontal mounting shelf should be constructed. Two anchors are installed in the structure and the tiltmeter is fastened to the anchors.Since signal cable will be subjected to the same pressure as the tiltmeter, it must be encased in waterproof conduit that has the same pressure rating as the tiltmeter. Continuous tubing is recommended.Tilt readings are obtained with a data logger or a portable readout. Readings are in volts and are converted to angles by applying conversion factors. Changes in tilt are found by comparing the current reading to the initial reading.The deepwater tiltmeter has a very narrow range, so it is necessary to \\\"null\\\" the sensor at installation time. This provides the maximum measurement range and also takes advantage of the sensor\\'s best characteristics. The EL Nulling Device or the EL Data Recorder are convenient tools for the nulling operation.",

In accordance with USEPA Method 180.1 for turbidity measurement the sensor is a 90 degree scatter nephelometer where a focused beam is directed into the monitored water. The light beam reflects off particles in the water, and the resultant light intensity is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90 degrees to the light beam. The detected light intensity is directly proportional to the turbidity of the water. The WQ770 sensor utilizes a second light detector to correct for light intensity variations, color changes, and minor lens fouling. All turbidity meters are factory calibrated to the highest standards and should not need recalibration for 6-12 months.

        "comment":"Since oxygen is involved in most of the biological and chemical processes in aquatic environments, it is the single most important parameter needed to be measured. Oxygen can also be used as a tracer in oceanographic studies.For environmental reasons it is critical to monitor oxygen in areas where the supply of oxygen is limited compared to demand e.g. In shallow coastal areas with significant algae blooms. In fjords or other areas with limited exchange of water. Around fish farms. In areas interesting for dumping of mine or dredging waste.The AADI Aanderaa Oxygen Optodes are based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers.The fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water.This sensing foil is attached to a sapphire window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight housing.The lifetime-based luminescence quenching principle offers the following advantages over electro-chemical sensors: Not stirring sensitive (it consumes no oxygen). Less affected by fouling. Measures absolute oxygen concentrations without repeated calibrations. Better long-term stability. Less affected by pressure. Pressure behaviour is predictable. Faster response time.The Oxygen Optode outputs data in AiCaP CANbus and RS-232. The sensor can present the O2 concentration in mM, the Air Saturation in % and the Temperature in C.The SEAGUARD datalogger and the smart sensor are interfaced by means of a reliable CANbus interface (AiCaP), using XML for plug and play capabilities.The smart sensors can be mounted directly on the top end plate of the AADI SEAGUARD and are automatically detected and recognized.",

This measurement is known to have a good correlation to the amount of suspended matter in water and can be used to monitor sediment, algae, or particle pollution. It is designed for use together with the Aanderaa Dataloggers or Display Units.The sensor head is cylindrically shaped, molded in Durotong and installed in an adapter made of Titanium. The sensor is furnished with a 10-pin receptacle for connection to the sensor cable. Two light emmiting diodes and one photo diode are pointing towards a common center at an angle of 15. The photodiode is furnished with a daylight filter. The electronic circuitry is molded in the sensor housing.When a measurement is taken the IR light emitting diode is switched on for half a second and sends a light beam into the water. If the surrounding water is clean and clear the photodiode will not detect this light. On the other hand, if the water is contaminated, scattered light from particles in the water will be sensed by the photodiode and a photocurrent will flow in the diode. This current gives a signal that signifies the amount of light that has been scattered. The signal is independent of the ambient light intensity and it is fully temperature compensated.The output is in the standard Aanderaa SR-10 format. The adapter also has a temperature probe measuring the exact water temperature and the output is in the standard Aanderaa VR22 format.The sensor is designed to avoid marine fouling. In any case, it is important to keep the plastic surfaces, covering the IR-LED and the photodiode, clean to ensure accurate measurements. When exposed to air, the sensor should read 0.1 NTU.",

The standard ANALITE NEP9000 and NEP9500 series of probes with its acetal housing may be submerged to a depth of 50 meters (165 feet). An optional stainless steel housing is available for applications where a greater depth rating is required but not recommended for deployment in salty or acidic water where crevice corrosion may occur. Its depth rating is 100 meters (330 feet). The ANALITE NEP9000 and NEP9500 probes use 90 optics and employs infrared light in accordance with ISO7027.

Where salinity variations are minimal, the conductivity signal offers unexcelled resolution of temperature structure. Used in conjunction with the SBE 8 Microstructure Temperature Sensor, the SBE 7 can provide comparably sensitive resolution of salinity and density fields. The sensing element is a remote-cabled, probe-mounted, 2-terminal, platinized electrode cell of dual needle configuration. The sensing elements completely open construction provides nearly total freedom from fouling. The sensor probe is a small, stainless steel assembly that may be mounted at distances up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) from the sensor electronics housing. This arrangement minimizes the effect of the instrument housing and its wake on the data. The cell electrodes are fabricated of solid platinum and are platinized to reduce the effect of polarization impedance on sensor response. The cell is driven by a sinusoidal voltage of approximately 0.24 Vrms at a frequency of 15 kHz. The resulting current is synchronously detected to provide a signal proportional to conductivity (transformer coupling is used to preclude the flow of galvanically induced currents into the electrodes). This signal is subsequently pre-emphasized so that the sensors output increases as a function of frequency. The effect of pre-emphasis is to magnify the sensor output for rapidly changing conductivity, therefore overcoming the restrictions on system resolving power that would otherwise be imparted by the use of conventional (e.g., 16-bit) digitizers. The SBE 7s pre-emphasis response magnifies a 100 Hz conductivity signal by a factor of 1000, facilitating acquisition of signals 1000 times smaller than could be characterized by conventional CTD sensors.",

Recorded data is stored in the loggers internal memory with a real-time clock reference for each measurement.The DST tilt is supported by the SeaStar software and the Communication Box which serves as an interface between the logger and a PC.  Communication between the logger and the Communication Box is wireless.In SeaStar, the user sets the start time, start date and sampling interval before starting the recorder. Up to seven different intervals can be set for the same measurement sequence. This is especially useful when more frequent measurements are needed at a certain time period.With default programming depth, temperature, and tilt are recorded at the same time. Optionally, temperature-depth and tilt can be set as primary and secondary parameter pairs/parameters with different sampling frequency. That way memory partitioning can be customized according to individual preferences.When the DST has been recovered, recorded data is uploaded to SeaStar where results are displayed both in graphic and tabular form. After retrieving the data, the DST can be re-programmed and reused as long as the battery lasts.",

It is designed for stationary applications and can be deployed on the bottom, on a mooring rig, on a buoy or on any other fixed structure. It is a complete instrument and includes all the parts required for a self contained deployment with data stored to an internal data logger. Typical applications include coastal studies, online monitoring and scientific studies in rivers, lakes, and channels. The Aquadopp profiler uses three acoustic beams slanted at 25 to accurately measure the current profile in a user selectable number of cells. The internal tilt and compass sensors tell the current direction and the high-resolution pressure sensor gives the depthand the tidal elevation if the system is fixed mounted. The standard 9 MB recorder and internal alkaline batteries are typically sufficient for a 24 month deployment. Deployment times can be increased or sampling schemes intensified by expanding to 161 MB memory and external batteries.",
