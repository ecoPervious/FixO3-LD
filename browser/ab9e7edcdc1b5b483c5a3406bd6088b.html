The W1-M3A observing system is composed by a large spare buoy and a sub-surface mooring periodically deployed close to the main buoy depending on specific research needs. The W1-M3A large spar buoy specifically designed for air-sea interaction studies and the collection of meteorological data even in rough sea. Stability is the basic feature of this type of buoy with respect to the other more classical approach based on discus-shaped buoys. The buoy was specifically designed as a stable measuring platform since its total mass, the unity buoyancy at the sea level, and presence of a damping disk allow for negligible sensitivity of sea heave and height.</div><div id="location"><div id="map"></div><script>var coords = {lat: 43.79, lng: 9.16};new google.maps.Marker({position: coords,map: new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {zoom: 4,center: coords})});</script></div></section></div></body></html>
