The site is located in the centre of the Irminger Gyre, characterized by particular deep winter mixed layer depth. The mixed layer deepening is promoted through the combination of the cyclonic circulation of the Irminger gyre and strong surface buoyancy forcing in winter. Focus of the interdisciplinary research is on the biogeochemical cycling in a potential deep water formtion area. The physical background field (Temperature, Salinity, Currents) of the upper 1500m is surveyed with a number of sensors. Moreover, biogeochemical sensors (O2, Chl-a, zooplankton) is measured in mixed layer. The site area is shared with the LOCO mooring established by the NIOZ in 2002. The sampling and logistics of the moorings is coordinated with the NACLIM project. In Septmber 2014 the CIS observatory was moved little south and the original position is now occupied by the 4 mooring construction as part of the US OOI initiative. With this configuration one observatory (OOI) is located at the center of the gyre, while CIS and LOCO are where typically the strongest buoyancy focring is found (related to the Greenland Tip Jet).</div><div id="location"><div id="map"></div><script>var coords = {lat: 59.7, lng: -39.7};new google.maps.Marker({position: coords,map: new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {zoom: 4,center: coords})});</script></div></section></div></body></html>
