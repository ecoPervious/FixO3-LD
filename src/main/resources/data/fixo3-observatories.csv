"CIS","Central Irminger Sea","Multidisciplinary mooring, located in the Central Irminger Sea, Subpolar North Atlantic and part of the FP7 NACLIM project. The site is located in the centre of the Irminger Gyre, characterized by particular deep winter mixed layer depth. The mixed layer deepening is promoted through the combination of the cyclonic circulation of the Irminger gyre and strong surface buoyancy forcing in winter. Focus of the interdisciplinary research is on the biogeochemical cycling in a potential deep water formtion area. The physical background field (Temperature, Salinity, Currents) of the upper 1500m is surveyed with a number of sensors. Moreover, biogeochemical sensors (O2, Chl-a, zooplankton) is measured in mixed layer. The site area is shared with the LOCO mooring established by the NIOZ in 2002. The sampling and logistics of the moorings is coordinated with the NACLIM project. In Septmber 2014 the CIS observatory was moved little south and the original position is now occupied by the 4 mooring construction as part of the US OOI initiative. With this configuration one observatory (OOI) is located at the center of the gyre, while CIS and LOCO are where typically the strongest buoyancy focring is found (related to the Greenland Tip Jet).","http://www.fixo3.eu/observatory/cis/"

The W1-M3A large spar buoy specifically designed for air-sea interaction studies and the collection of meteorological data even in rough sea. Stability is the basic feature of this type of buoy with respect to the other more classical approach based on discus-shaped buoys. The buoy was specifically designed as a stable measuring platform since its total mass, the unity buoyancy at the sea level, and presence of a damping disk allow for negligible sensitivity of sea heave and height.","http://www.fixo3.eu/observatory/w1-m3a/"
