Site is part of the MOOSE network providing real-time data transmission through two deep cabled moorings. These moorings are complemented by stand-alone mooring near the junction box. Physical and biogeochemical parameters recorded by autonomous sensors with regular maintenance. In addition monthly ship occupation for CTD profiles and seawater collection. Cabled extension of the neutrino telescope is offering connectors for direct link to shore in addition to operational seismometer already in place.</div><div id="location"><div id="map"></div><script>var coords = {lat: 42.8, lng: 6.17};new google.maps.Marker({position: coords,map: new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {zoom: 4,center: coords})});</script></div></section></div></body></html>
